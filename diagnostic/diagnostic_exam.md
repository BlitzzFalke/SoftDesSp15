## Software Design Mid-Semester Diagnostic Self-Exam


1. **`print` vs `return`**

	Modify this function to satisfy the following conditions:

	- Print the input
	- Return the input multiplied by 4

	```
	def print_and_return(input):
		print "I'm a string!"
		return None
	```

	- What is the difference between return and print? 
	- How many things can we print in a function? 
	- How many things can we return?
	- What happens if your input is a string?

1. **Conditional Statements**

	Modify this function to satisfy the following conditions:

	- Return `True` if `number1` is greater or equal to `number2`
	- Print "Big input!" if either number is greater than 10
	- If an input is not a number, return `False`
	
	```
	def conditional_statements(number1, number2):
		pass
	```
	
	- What is the difference between `if`, `elif`, and `else`?

1. **List operations**

	Modify this function to satisfy the following conditions:

	- Print the length of the list
	- Check if the input is in the list, append it to the list if it isn't, print "Already here!" if it is
	- Print the first 3 values of the list
	- Return the last value of the list
	
	```
	def list_operations(input):
    	test_list = [20,1,3,24,6,9]
		return None
	```
	
	- How is a list indexed?
	- How do we remove and add items from a list?

1. **Loops**

	Modify this function to satisfy the following conditions (you can assume `input` is an iterable):
	
	- Create a while loop what will print every value in the input
	- Create a for loop that will print every value in the input. Do not use `range(len(input))`
	- Return a value randomly chosen from the input
	
	```
	def for_vs_while_loops(input):
	    pass
	```
    
    - What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop? 
    - In what situation should you use each?
